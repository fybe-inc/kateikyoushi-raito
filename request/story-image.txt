Anime style illustration depicting the founding story of "家庭教師ライト". A group of diverse college students in casual smart attire standing together with determined expressions, suggesting a team of passionate tutors. Behind them is a university building (resembling Keio University) with cherry blossoms, and in front of them are symbolic elements representing their mission: floating books, graduation caps, and glowing path leading to younger students. The college students have varied appearances but share confident poses and friendly expressions. Background transitions from university to community setting. Dynamic composition with the team slightly angled to create depth. Color palette focuses on blues and purples with accent colors for each character. Soft lighting effects creating inspirational atmosphere. 3:2 aspect ratio, high detail, subtle motion lines suggesting movement forward, no text overlay.
