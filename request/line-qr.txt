Anime style illustration of a modern LINE QR code display. The QR code itself should be accurately depicted in the center (placeholder for actual QR code), surrounded by a decorative frame with anime-style educational elements. The frame features small character mascots in school uniforms pointing toward the QR code with speech bubbles saying "友だち追加" (Add Friend). Surrounding the QR code are subtle LINE app visual elements and educational icons like books, pencils, and graduation caps floating in a gentle spiral pattern. Background gradient in Light Green (LINE's brand color) to white. The illustration maintains clean lines and vibrant colors typical of anime style. 3:2 aspect ratio (though can be cropped to square when implemented), high detail, magical particle effects around the QR area, no text overlay except for the speech bubbles. The overall design should be cute and inviting while maintaining the functionality of the QR code.
